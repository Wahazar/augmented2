BUG TRACKING:
https://github.com/Wahazar/augmented2/issues
(please do not open tickets related with this modpack on freeciv bugtracker)

----------

OBJECTIVES:
-----------

- Better balanced and more sophisticated technology tree, 62 new techs.
  Facultative advance paths based on Asiatic culture (Arab, Hindu, Chinese, Japonese) 
  - not required for mainstream technology path, but granting some extra units/buildings/wonders.

- Clearly distinctive tiers of military unit classes: 
  defensive infantry, assault infantry, fast assault units, reconnaissance, 
  direct fire artillery, plunging fire artillery, peacekeepers, turrets etc.

- Well defined tiers of ships classes: river/coastal merchants, river/coastal warships, ocean merchants, ocean warships. 

- Ships and armoured train have decreased attack alone, but can be equipped with turret guns (destroyer and patrol boat also torpedos). 
- Submarines can carry torpedos (nuclear submarine also missiles). 
- Bombers, strike aircrafts/advanced fighters can carry bombs (and torpedos). 

- Enginners can carry other unit.

- New buildings and wonders, adopted to the new technology tree. 
  Some industrial improvements give additional bonus from certain tiles.
  City radius depend on city size and improvements.

- Some building and especially wonders require certain level of Culture Points. These can be earned 
  each turn from some other buildings, or granted by special events.

- New governments and altered governments properties.

- Upkeep cost depend on unit type and tier.

- Smooth changes in upkeep system between different government systems.

- No additional income from caravan arrival and decreased income from traderoutes.

INFO:
-----

- Ruleset base is civ2/civ3, but with profound changes.

- Help texts have been updated (mainly Buildings and Wonders), so the
  info showed ingame already takes into account the changed rules. Note
  that some graphical tables from the Manual will not match (mainly
  Terrains and Governments), so better use the tables in this ReadMe as
  reference.

- Help pages on freeciv wiki: https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Augmented2_ruleset_modpack

The following is a full list of changes compared to civ2/civ3 ruleset...


CORE CHANGES:
-------------

- Every unit pays some kind of Upkeep cost, for example 1 food, 1 gold in case of medieval infantry, 
  or 1 shield, 1 food, 1 gold in case of gunpowder era infantry. 
  There is no abrupt change of upkeep system after revolution, each goverment pays all 3 upkeep prices, 
  however free upkeep threshold for shield and gold depend on government. Food upkeep is scalable with city size as usual.

- Units lose one Veteran level when auto-upgraded by Leonardo Workshop or DARPA wonders.

- Unlimited movement on rails delayed to maglev (available with
  Superconductors). Movement bonus on Railroads apply only for Land and Small Land units. 
  There is no movement bonus for Rivers, and Coasters are going non diagonal.

- Some key techs require no holes in its tech roots. To acquire a tech you must know its
  prerequisites, and you cannot lose a tech that another depends on.

- Enabled risk of Plague at cities with population greater than 4. Chances
  reduced by the buildings Aqueduct, Sewer System, Lazaretto/Hospital
  and the wonders: Pasteur Institute and Cure for Cancer.

FOODBOX:
--------

not changed yet

TERRAIN:
--------

- Transforming terrain from forest/to forest possible with Forestry tech.

- Dirt road or river is required to add shield to rough terrain such Hills, Forest, Jungle, Mountains or Taiga.

- Jungles receive +1 Shield (2/1/0) with Railroad on its tile and Railway Station in city. 
  Swamps can be irrigated for +1 Food (to 2/0/0), next irrigation convert them to grassland. 
  Tundras can be mined for +1 Shield (instead of irrigated)
  and receive +1 Trade when roaded (up to 1/1/1).

- Deserts with a river receive 1 extra Food from irrigation (total 2),
  unless they have an Oasis; this simulates a growth boost like Nile
  floods.

- Irrigation possible with Agriculture Farming tech, and can be performed if River or Lake is adjacent to tile, 
  or another irrigated tile is cardinally adjacent. Electricity allow to irrigate if Sea is cardinally adjacent, 
  and Recycling allow to irrigate without any restrictions.

- Mountains give extra vision range for small reconnaissance units. Cities can not be placed over
  Mountains. Regular military units can't go into unroaded mountains, except of spec-ops units.

- The discovery of Copper Mining allow mining, but without any effect, Bronze Working allow production of mines.

- Mines+Railroads in mountains and deserts give extra Shield production, if Cement Plant and Railroad Station is builded in city. 
  Mines+Railroads on coal give extra trade point in above case. 

- Mines+Railroads on coal give extra Shield production, if Steel Plant and Railroad Station is builded in city. 
  Mines+Railroads on iron give extra trade point in above case. 

- Forest give extra Shield production, if Textille Mill is builded in city. 

- Mines on deserts give extra Shield production, if Manufacture is builded in city. 
- Mines on coal give extra gold production in above case, or if Coal Power and Railroad Station plant is builded in city. 

- The discovery of Refining allows to upgrade the mines placed on
  Deserts and Glaciers to Oil Wells (+2 Shields in total). Refinery gains additional gold from each Oil Well on Oil.

- Deep ocean tiles must be mined (resulting in an Oil Platform) in order to
  take advantage of the shield bonus from Offshore Platforms. Refinery in city is required.

- Pollution may appear in Ocean tiles, and Transports or Barges can clean it
  without the need of Workers/Engineers. Jungles and Forests are less
  affected by global warming.

- Environmentalism allow to make Wind Turbine on hills with irrigation.

- No minimum city output. City central tile simply gets  +1 Shield, and without mine, +1 Food 

- Tile transform is possible when Combustion tech is known (with some earlier exception for steam barge).

- Terrain transformation pattern -

DEFENSE:
--------

- Halved the terrain defense bonuses, now more similar to civ3 values:

TERRAIN

(only military units can fortify; inside cities, they are
always considered fortified)

BASE             VS LAND  VS SEA   VS AIR   VS MISSILE/BOMB
Fort             +50%     +50%     +0%      +0%
Fortress         +100%    +100%    +50%     +50%

SDI Defense      +0%      +0%      +0%      +100%/50%

- Every City of any size receives an inherent Defend_Bonus = +50%
  against all kinds of land units except of Train and Turrets.

- Every City with Pop>8 receives an additional free Defend_Bonus = +50%
  against land units.

- Walls effect not apply against plunging fire units. 

- Great Wall gives additional Defend_Bonus = +50% against Land units,
  and prevents population loss in any allied city when a defending unit loses.

Total Defense = (UNIT DEFENSE) * (100+TERRAIN)/100 * (100+RIVER)/100
 * (100+CITY+BASE)/100 * (100+FORTIFIED)/100 * (100+VETERAN)/100
(Same as classic rules).


GOVERNMENTS:
------------

1. 
All governments pay shield, food and gold upkeep, however upkeep free differ depending on government. 
For example Monarchy have 4 unit shield upkeep free, but only 3 units gold upkeep free, 
while First Republic only 1 unit shield  upkeep free, but 4 units gold upkeep free. 
Food upkeep depend only on city size (except of Communism, which offer more free food).

2. Neither government is immune on bribery or revolting (except of cities with Palace etc, or Fascism without Statue of Liberty). 
However cost of such actions depend on government, and sometimes on Wonders 
(for example, 200% for inciting revolt in case of Democracy without Slavery Abolition, 1000 % with)

3. There is no extra gold per tile in Democracy or Republic 
(unless Women's Suffrage wonder exists, wich gives such effect for Democracy, or extra shield for Republic).
But some governments have bonuses or penalties while producing gold, science or luxury.
For example science and gold is suppressed under Tribalism, while improved under Republic.

4. Additional unhappines is generated proportional to enemy nationality percentage in your city.
It can throw out Tribal, Democracy or Republic gov.
